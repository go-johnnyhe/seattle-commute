# Seattle Commute CLI 🚌

A simple command-line tool for Seattle commuters to get optimal transit routes and schedules using Google Maps transit data.

## Features

- ⚡ **Zero-friction UX**: No location detection needed - assumes you're commuting between home and work
- 🏠 Routes home with `commute` (assumes you're at work)
- 💼 Routes to work with `commute -w` (assumes you're at home)
- 🗺️ **Arbitrary routing** with `commute "from" "to"` for any Seattle locations
- ⏰ Shows next several departure times in the next 2 hours
- 🚌 Real-time transit information for Seattle Metro, Sound Transit, and more
- 💾 Saves your home/work addresses for quick access

## Quick Start

1. **Get a Google Maps API Key**:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Enable the Directions API
   - Create an API key
   - (Free tier includes 40,000 requests/month)

2. **Install and Setup**:
   ```bash
   go build -o commute
   ./commute init "123 Your St, Seattle, WA"
   ```

3. **Daily Usage**:
   ```bash
   ./commute                              # Routes home (assumes you're at work)
   ./commute -w                           # Routes to work (assumes you're at home)
   ./commute "U District" "Capitol Hill"  # Arbitrary routing between any two places
   ```

## Commands

```

## Configuration

Config is stored at `~/.seattle-commute/config.json`:

```json
{
  "home_address": "123 Main St, Seattle, WA",
  "work_address": "456 Work Ave, Seattle, WA",
  "google_api_key": "your-api-key-here"
}
```

## Installation

**Option 1: Build from source**
```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd seattle-commute-cli
go build -o commute
```

**Option 2: Add to PATH for global access**
```bash
go build -o commute
sudo mv commute /usr/local/bin/
# Now you can run 'commute' from anywhere!
```

## How It Works

1. **Zero-Friction UX**: Assumes you're commuting between home and work (no location detection needed)
2. **Transit API**: Queries Google Maps Directions API with transit mode
3. **Smart Scheduling**: Gets multiple departure times over the next 2 hours
4. **Route Optimization**: Shows the best routes sorted by departure time
5. **Real-time Data**: Includes live Seattle Metro, Sound Transit, and streetcar schedules

## Requirements

- Go 1.18+
- Google Maps API key with Directions API enabled
- Internet connection for real-time transit data

## Privacy & Data

- Your location is detected via IP address only
- No location data is stored or transmitted except to Google Maps API
- Config file contains only addresses you provide and your API key
- All data stays on your local machine

## Troubleshooting

**"No routes found"**:
- Check that your addresses are valid Seattle-area locations
- Verify transit service is available at the current time

**"Configuration not found"**:
- Run `commute init` to set up your addresses and API key

**"Failed to get location"** (only when using `--from` flag):
- Check your internet connection
- IP geolocation fallback may be affected by VPNs
